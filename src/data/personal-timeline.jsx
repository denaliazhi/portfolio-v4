        At the age of 18, I decided— instead of
        engineering— to attend business school
        where I learned a thing or two about
        communication.

          Over four years, I'd design for two
          startups, a nonprofit, and a student
          publication in my free time. Through
          these experiences, I'd hone my eye for
          detail and composition.

          I'd go on to pursue a minor in CS along
          with a "more technical" concentration at
          the business school. I'd strengthen my
          analytical skills through courses like
          Data Structures, Database Management,
          and Data-Driven Decision Making.

          My interests in design and web

          During my senior summer, I interned as a
          data analyst at a financial services
          company. While I liked working between
          product and engineering, I wasn't sure
          the role was for me. Well, I'd give it a
          shot. I returned for a full-time
          position.

          During my two years as a data analyst, I
          came to several realizations which led
          me, ultimately, to pursue a different
          path for myself.
