        At the age of 18, I decided— instead of
        engineering— to attend business school
        where I learned a thing or two about
        communication.

          tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator.

          Over four years, I'd design for two
          startups, a nonprofit, and a student
          publication in my free time. Through
          these experiences, I'd hone my eye for
          detail and composition.

          I did writing discounted cash flows. By
          the end, I'd built my very own web app.

          During my remaining time in college, I'd
          pursue a minor in CS along with a "more
          technical" concentration at the business
          school. I'd strengthen my analytical
          skills through courses like Data
          Structures, Database Management, and
          Data-Driven Decision Making.

          My interests in design and web

          During my senior summer, I interned as a
          data analyst at a financial services
          company. While I liked working between
          product and engineering, I wasn't quite
          sure the role was for me. Well, only one
          way to find out. I returned for a
          full-time position.

          After college, I came to several
          personal and professional realizations.
          One of them was that I needed to pursue
          a different path for myself.
